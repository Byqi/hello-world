# hello-world

Hi guys,

I am Muhammad Hafiz Baihaqi Bin Hazman fresh graduate with Degree in Information System Engineering and looking forward to become a successfull web/software developer. 

During my studyk, I learn  many things about this field including programming, image and video editing. The programming language that I used to use is asp.net, java and php at between beginner and intermediate level. I also can do image editing using photoshop or illustrator while video editing by using Sony Vegas.

I am a quick leaner and quite hardworking person. Thats all.

Thank you.
